## Quick Start <span id="quick_start"></span>

**Want to try it out first?** Before proceeding with the full setup, you can use
the pre-built binaries for desktop or the [Google AI Edge Gallery](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery)
app for mobile to run LiteRT-LM immediately.

### Mobile Apps

The Google AI Edge Gallery is a demo app that puts the power of
cutting-edge Generative AI models directly into your hands, powered by
LiteRT-LM.

-   [Android AI Edge Gallery App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ai.edge.gallery&hl=en_US&pli=1)
-   [iOS AI Edge Gallery app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-ai-edge-gallery/id6749645337)
-   [AI Edge Gallery GitHub](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery)

### Desktop CLI (Lit)

-   [MacOS ARM64](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/releases/download/v0.9.0-alpha03/lit.macos_arm64)
-   [Linux x86_64](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/releases/download/v0.9.0-alpha03/lit.linux_x86_64)
-   [Linux ARM64](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/releases/download/v0.9.0-alpha03/lit.linux_arm64)
-   [Windows x86_64](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/releases/download/v0.9.0-alpha03/lit.windows_x86_64.exe)

After downloading the `lit` binary, just run `lit` to see the options.
Here is a simple use case:

```shell
# Set the HuggingFace token in the HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN environment variable
# so that lit can pull the model from HuggingFace.

# On Linux or MacOS
export HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"

# On Windows Command Prompt
set HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token

# On Windows Powershell
$env:HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN = "your_huggingface_token"
```

```shell
lit list --show_all
lit pull gemma3-1b
lit run gemma3-1b [--backend=<cpu|gpu>]
```

<summary>Tips and platform specific steps</summary>

Note: **Running GPU on Windows requires the DirectXShaderCompiler.**
 <span id="windows_gpu"></span>
 Download the dxc_2025_07_14.zip or the latest zip file from
 https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases, unzip the file and
 locate the right architecture directory under `bin`, copy the `dxil.dll` and
 `dxcompiler.dll` into the same directory as the executable like `lit` or
 `litert_lm_main`.

Tip: For more functionality, use `lit --help` or `lit <command> --help`

Tip: Follow this [link](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) to
get your own Hugging Face token

Tip: You may have to `chmod +x lit` and explicitly approve the usage of
pre-built binaries. For example, in MacOS, you should go to **System Settings >
Privacy & Security > Security** to approve the binary.

## 🔧 Build Your App: API & SDK References

The LiteRT-LM SDK provides high-level, idiomatic abstractions to integrate LLMs
into your applications with minimal boilerplate. These APIs manage the entire
lifecycle—from **model loading and tokenization** to **hardware acceleration**
and **session management**.

## Choose Your Platform

## Building from Source (Advanced)

🛑 **Note for App Developers:** You do **not** need to build this project from
 source to use it in your apps. If you are using Kotlin, Swift, or Python,
 please use our pre-built SDKs listed in the
 [Choose Your Platform](#choose-your-platform) section above.

This section provides [instructions]((./docs/getting-started/build-and-run.md))
for compiling the core LiteRT-LM C++ framework from scratch. You should only
follow these steps if you are:

* **A core contributor** fixing bugs or adding features to the LiteRT-LM engine.
* **A native C++ developer** who requires custom compilation flags for an
embedded system.

Below are the performance numbers of running each model on various devices. Note
that the benchmark is measured with 1024 tokens prefill and 256 tokens decode (
with performance lock on Android devices).

| FunctionGemma | Samsung S25<br>(Ultra) | CPU | 1718.4 | 125.9 | 1024 |

Note that the first time a given model is loaded on a given device, it will
take longer to load. This is because the model weights are being arranged to run
optimally on your particular device. Subsequent loads will be faster
because the optimized weights are cached on your device.

### Model Hosting and Deployment

When a model exceeds 1.5GB, it often surpasses the "over-the-air" download
limits of cellular networks or the internal limits of standard app bundles.
A remote fetch strategy is required.

Host your model file, then have your app fetch the latest version of your
model URL for download. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) provides
solutions for downloading large files on [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/android/download-files)
and [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/ios/download-files).

Alternatively, you can fetch a model directly from HuggingFace by using the
[HuggingFace API](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/download).
For private or gated models, you will need to include a Hugging Face User
Access Token in the `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` header of your download
request.

## Release Notes

*   ***Jan 31, 2026*** **: Repository Migration to Git LFS**

**The LiteRT-LM repository has been migrated to use
[Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.com) for all prebuilt binaries.**
Because this involved a history rewrite to shrink the repository size, all
previous commit hashes are now invalid.

### Action Required:
If you have a local copy of this repository from before **January 31, 2026**,
your local history is now incompatible with the remote. **Please do not attempt
to `git pull`.**

To fix your local environment, please perform a fresh clone:

```bash
# 1. Remove your old directory (or move it to a backup).
rm -rf LiteRT-LM

# 2. Re-clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM.git
cd LiteRT-LM

# 3. Ensure LFS is initialized. If this is your first time installing LFS,
#    download LFS from https://git-lfs.com.
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

    On-Device LLMs** We're proud to release an early preview (`v0.6.1`) of the
    LiteRT-LM codebase! This foundational release enables you to run the latest
    Gemma series models across a wide of devices with initial support for CPU
    execution and powerful GPU acceleration on Android.

## FAQ

### LiteRT vs LiteRT-LM vs MediaPipe GenAI Tasks

LiteRT, LiteRT-LM, and MediaPipe GenAI Tasks are three libraries within the
Google AI Edge stack that build on each other. By exposing functionality at
different abstraction layers, we hope to enable developers to balance their
respective needs between flexibility and complexity.

[LiteRT](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert) is Google AI Edge's underlying
on-device runtime. Developers can convert individual PyTorch, TensorFlow, and
JAX models to LiteRT and run them on-device.

**LiteRT-LM** gives developers the pipeline framework to stitch together
multiple LiteRT models with pre- and post-processing components (e.g.,
tokenizer, vision encoder, text decoder).

[MediaPipe GenAI Tasks](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/genai/llm_inference)
are out-of-the-box native APIs (Kotlin, Swift, JS) to run language models by
just setting a few parameters such as temperature and topK.

### .litertlm vs .task

MediaPipe GenAI Tasks currently use `.task` files to represent language models.
Task files are zip archives of multiple LiteRT files, components, and metadata.
`.litertlm` is an evolution of the `.task` file format to include additional
metadata and enable better compression.

During our LiteRT-LM preview, we will release a small number of `.litertlm`
files. MediaPipe APIs will continue to use `.task` files. Once we have the first
full release of LiteRT-LM, we will migrate MediaPipe APIs to use the new
`.litertlm` files and release a wider collection of `.litertlm` files on the
[LiteRT Hugging Face Community](https://huggingface.co/litert-community)
